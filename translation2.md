B. Grammatical questions

1. Identify the antecedent of cui, and its gender and number. Then explain what case cui is, and how it functions in the relative clause. (I.e., why is cui in this case?) - antecedent: "flumen magnum," neuter and singular to match the number and gender of the antecedent, dative - functions as a dative of the possessor. 

2. Identify the form of transire. Explain why you placed it in the clause you chose. - present infinitive. It is a complementary infinitive which completes the idea of poterat.

4. sublatam is from a verb that is a compound of sub plus a verb you should know very well. Identify the form of this participle (which for participles means: gender, case, number, tense voice). Find the dictionary entry for this word in thed Lewis-Short’s Latin Dictionary, and give its URN here. - feminine, accusative, singular, perfect, passive, participle. 
URN: "sufferō sustulī, sublātus, sufferre - sub+fero, to take up, submit to, undergo, bear"

4. Identify the form of sagittis. Why does Hyginus use this case? - ablative, ablative of agent - "by the arrow"

5. Identify the form of moriens. - present active participle, masculine, singular, nominative.

6. Identify felle. Why does Hyginus use this case? - ablative case, used as an ablative of agent - "by the poisinous liquid"

7. Identify the form of tinctas. - perfect, passive, participle, plural, feminine, accusative 

8. Identify the form of exceptum. - masculine, accusative, singular

9. William Faulkner’s novel As I lay dying takes its title from an English translation of a single word in Odyssey 11.424. In Greek, where participles function very differently from English but similarly to Latin, that word is a present active participle. Suggest one or more possible translations of Faulkner’s title into Latin. - moriens (present active participle) 

Translation: 

Deianira, Hercules' wife, was not able to cross the river, Evenus, and she asked the for help from Nessus who was the son of Ixionis and Nubis. 

He himself wished to rape Deinira, who was carried in the River itself. 

When Hercules intervened and Deinira begged in tears for his help, he peirced Nessus with the arrows. 

Hercules, while he knew that he was dying because the arrows had great power because they had been soaked in the poison of the Hydra of Lerna, gave his own blood that he had drawn out to Dienira and said that it was a love potion.
