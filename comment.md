Commenting on Latin reading:
As you did in translation 2, please select two choices of syntax, word order, or diction that Hyginus makes from anywhere in your Latin reading, and comment briefly on how Hyginus’ choice complements or enhances the meaning of the passage’s content.
Discuss briefly: no more than 2-4 sentences for each example. Italicize Latin words when citing them.
You may select examples from anything you have looked at in Hyginus, from the narrative of his 12 deeds in chapter 30, or the story of his death in chapter 36.

1. Hyginus Chapter 30, Section 3
"haec tantam uim ueneni habuit ut afflatu homines necaret, et si quis eam dormientem transierat, uestigia eius afflabat et *maiori cruciatu moriebatur.*"
In the excerpt above, Hyginus describes the power of poison of the Hydra of Lerna and the way that she killed those who discturbed her with her breath. More specifically, Hyginus tells us that those who are subjected to her breath die by great torture (*maiori cruciatu moriebatur.*). It is noteworthy that Hyginus chooses to describe this scene in such a way, rather than just saying "they died" or "they were tortured," because his choice emphasizes the frightening power of the Hydra's poison and thereby intensifies the scene and reinforces Hercules' strength becaue of his ability to kill such a terrifying and dangerous monster. 

2. Hyginus Chapter 30, Section 2
"*Leonem Nemeum,* quem Luna nutrierat in antro amphistomo atrotum, necauit, cuius pellem pro tegumento habuit."
The word order of this section, much like the other sections in Hyginus' telling of the life, deeds, and death of Hercules, helps to provide an outlined overview of the plot. By starting the sentence with *"Leonem Nemeum,"* the direct object of the sentence, Hyginus immediately tells us what the section is going to be about: the Nemean Lion. Further, he choses not to begin the sentence with "Hercules," who is the implied subject, because doing so would be unnessecary as readers already know that Hercules is the protagonist of all of the sections.
