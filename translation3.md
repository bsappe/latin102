2. Taurum cum quo Pasiphae concubuit ex Creta insula Mycenis vivum adduxit.
He led the living bull, with whom Pasiphae laid, from the island of Crete to Mycenae. 

3. Diomedem Thraciae regem et equos quattuor eius, qui carne humana vescebantur, cum Abdero famulo interfecit; equorum autem nomina Podargus Lampon Xanthus Dinus.
Hercules killed Diomedes, the king of Thrace, with the slave Abdero, and his four horses who fed on the flesh of humans; also the names of the horses were Podargus, Lampon, Xanthus, and Dinus. 

A. Grammatical analysis
Place each verbal idea (clause, indirect statement, participial expression) on a separate line, indented to show its level of subordination. Italicize the verb of each unit by surrounding it with asterisks.

1. 
Augeae regis stercus bobile uno die *purgavit*, 
maiorem partem Iove adiutore; 
> flumine admisso 
totum stercus *abluit*.

2. 
Taurum 
> cum quo Pasiphae *concubuit* 
ex Creta insula Mycenis vivum *adduxit.*

3. 
Diomedem Thraciae regem et equos quattuor eius, 
>qui carne humana *vescebantur*, 
cum Abdero famulo *interfecit*; 
equorum autem nomina Podargus Lampon Xanthus Dinus. 

B. Grammatical questions
1. In the phrase, Iove adiutore, what case is Iove? What kind of construction is this phrase - ablative, used to explain how the main verb of the statement was accomplished, ablative absolute construction. 

2. What case is stercus, and why is it in that case? - stercus is in the accusative form because it is the direct object of the verb "purgavit"

3. Identify the form of the adjective maiorem (gender, case, number, degree). - feminine, accusative, singular, comparative (agrees with partem)

4. Explain the construction of the verbal unit flumine admisso.- admisso is the perfect, pasive, participle of the verb admitto, admittis, admittere, admissum - to admit/recieve/let in, it is used to describe the context by which Hercules was able to clean the river. 

5. What are the gender, number, case, and antecedent of qui? - masculine, plural, nominative, equis quattuor

6. What Latin verb form has to be understood in the clause that runs from equorum to Dinus? - implied verb - "Erant - were" (from Sum, Esse, Fui, Futurus)

C. Literary commentary
Choose two choices of syntax, word order, or diction that Hyginus makes in this passage that complement or enhance the meaning of the passageâ€™s content. Discuss briefly s in 3-4 sentences. Italicize Latin words when citing them.

1. In section 9, Hyginas chooses to list the names of the horses at the end of the sentence. I think that he chooses this word order in an effort not to clutter the sentence. By doing so, he makes sure that the extra information of the horses nams, which is not essential fot the understanding of the sentence, does not detract from the main action of Hercules. 
2. In section 8, Hercules specifies that Crete is and island when he says *Creta insula.* By making it clear that Crete is an island, Hyginus emphasizes the difficulty or magnitude of Hercules' journey from Crete to Mycene. Because Crete is an island, readers may assume that Hercules had to travel both by water and land to bring the bull to Mycene.
