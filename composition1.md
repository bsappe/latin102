**Needs revisions**
**Very fine first draft!**


1. Your first sentence should use a temporal clause to express that when Hercules came to Oechalia, he asked to marry Iole.
>Cum Hercules Oechaliae venisset, petivit Iolen uxorem ducere.
2. Your second sentence should state that when her father Eurytus was unwilling, Hercules captured Oechalia.
>Cum pater Iolī noluisset🤔, Hercules Oechaliam cepit.
3. Your third sentence should express that Hercules said that he would kill her parents, and should include an indirect statement.
>Hercules dixit eum❌ eī❌ parentes interficere❌.
>>Revision: Hercules dixit se eius parentes interfecturus esse.
4. Your fourth sentence should say that Iole endured that her parents were killed.
>Quia Iolī parentes interfecti essent, ea passus est.❌
>>Revision: Quia Iolī parentes interfecti essent, ea patiebatur.
5. Your fifth statement should say that when he had killed all of them, he sent Iole to Deianira.
>Cum Hercules ea omnia❌ interfecissent❌, is Iolen Deianiram❌ misit. 
>>Revision: Cum Hercules ea omnes interficiebat, is Iolen Deianirae misit.
