Part C: Translation
"When Hercules went into hospitality near King Dexamenus and then deflowered his daughter, Deianira, he wished to lead her as his wife (to marry her). When Hercules left 🤔 (*absum = "to be away, absent"*), the centaur, Eurytion, sought to marry Deinira. Because the father was afraid of the centaur, he promised to give his daugter to him. On a certain day, the centaur went with his brothers to the wedding. Hercules came and killed the centaurs and led Deianira away."
